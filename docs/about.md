# About mlconfound

The lack of rigorous non-parametric statistical tests of confoudner-effects significantly hampers the development of
robust, valid and generalizable predictive models in many fields of research.
The package `mlconfound` implements the *partial* and *full confounder tests* [1], that build on a recent theoretical framework of conditional 
independence testing [2] and test the null hypothesis of *no bias* and *fully biased model*, respectively.
The proposed tests set no assumptions about the distribution of the predictive model output that is often non-normal.
As shown by theory and simulations, the test are statistically valid, robust and display a high statistical power.
